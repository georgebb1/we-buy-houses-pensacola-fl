Hi, I'm building a new website for a company that wants to rank for "[we buy houses pensacola fl](https://www.cmbuyshouses.com/)". It's the first time I'm using Rails and I installed a whole bunch of apps to get things going. I have MSYS2, Rails 5.1.2 (latest version), I installed Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (pretty cool), I also tried Atom a little bit, but it's a bit more complicated and I don't have the time to learn it right now.

It feels like I'm doing a complicated thing, but I think I can learn everything little by little. This community helps a lot, I found everything I needed so far. So back to work and I'll let you know how things are going.
